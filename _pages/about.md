![CMU colleagues](/images/CMU_patio.jpg)

I am currently a Ph.D. student in statistics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html), entering in 2021. Before joining CMU, I worked at the [Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)](https://www.iadb.org/en) as a data scientist in Washington, D.C. Simultaneously, I completed a masterâ€™s degree in mathematics and statistics at [Georgetown University](https://mathstat.georgetown.edu/graduate/). 


My primary area of interest is uncertainty quantification (UQ) on temporal data using recurrent neural networks, with applications to nuclear fusion and natural disaster management. This is the subject of my research in summer 2024, which is funded by the [AI Institute for Societal Decision Making (AI-SDM)](https://www.cmu.edu/ai-sdm/index.html). I am advised by [Arun Kuchibhotla (Statistics Department)](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/), whose expertise includes forecasting methods and prediction intervals for temporal and online datasets.

======

* I love [painting](https://www.instagram.com/selina.carter.art), especially portraits. I have taken art classes from an early age at the Maine College of Art and from various artists in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

* I like to run. I used to run cross-country. Pittsburgh has excellent hills, which is one reason I chose CMU. I also sometimes play pick-up soccer.

* I love raising pet chickens. I grew up on a farm in Maine and I sold eggs to neighbors. I also had a [pet chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvbMS_YSOF0) in Mozambique.
